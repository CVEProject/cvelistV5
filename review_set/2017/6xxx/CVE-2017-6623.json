The vulnerability is due to incorrect sudoers permissions on the script file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and providing crafted user input at the CLI, using this script file to escalate their privilege level and execute commands as root. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to acquire root-level privileges and take full control of the appliance. The user has to be logged-in to the device with valid credentials for a specific set of users. The Cisco Policy Suite application is vulnerable when running software versions 10.0.0, 10.1.0, or 11.0.0. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc07366."
