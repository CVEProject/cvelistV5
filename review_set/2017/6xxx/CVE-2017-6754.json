The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of certain user-supplied fields that are subsequently used by the affected software to build SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted URLs, which are designed to exploit the vulnerability, to the affected software. To execute an attack successfully, the attacker would need to submit a number of requests to the affected software.
