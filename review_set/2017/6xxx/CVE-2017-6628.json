The vulnerability is due to a Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) alert being incorrectly handled when in a specific SSL/TLS connection state. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a SMART-SSL connection through the targeted device. The attacker would then send a crafted stream of SSL/TLS traffic.
