The account could be granted root- or system-level privileges. The vulnerability exists because the affected software has a default user account that has a default, static password. The user account is created automatically when the software is installed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting remotely to an affected system and logging in to the affected software by using the credentials for this default user account. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use this default user account to log in to the affected software and gain access to the administrative console of a DCNM server.
