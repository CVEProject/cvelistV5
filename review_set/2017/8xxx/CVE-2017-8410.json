The number of bytes to be copied are calculated based on the length of the string sent in the RTSP header by the client.

The severity of this attack is enlarged by the fact that the same value is then copied on the stack in the function 0x00011378 and this allows to overflow the buffer allocated and thus control the PC register which will result in arbitrary code execution on the device."
