As a part of that communication, the device uses custom version of base64 encoding to pass data back and forth between the apps and the device. However, the same form of communication can be initiated by any process including an attacker process on the mobile phone or the desktop and this allows a third party to retrieve the device's password without any authentication by sending just 1 UDP packet with custom base64 encoding.
