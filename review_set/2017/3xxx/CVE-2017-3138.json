In most instances this is not as bad as it sounds, because existing commands permitted over the control channel (i.e. \"rndc stop\") can already be given to cause the server to stop.\n\nHowever, BIND 9.11.0 introduced a new option to allow \"read only\" commands over the command channel.  Using this restriction, a server can be configured to limit specified clients to giving control channel commands which return information only (e.g. \"rndc status\") without affecting the operational state of the server.  The defect described in this advisory, however, is not properly stopped by the \"read only\" restriction, in essence permitting a privilege escalation allowing a client which should only be permitted the limited set of \"read only\" operations to cause the server to stop execution.",
