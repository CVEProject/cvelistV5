This can occur during periods of heavy route churn, causing the Multi-Service Process to stop processing updates, without consuming any further updates from kernel. This back pressure towards the kernel affects further dynamic updates from other processes in the system, including RPD, causing a KRT-STUCK condition and traffic forwarding issues.

This can occur during periods of heavy route churn, causing the Multi-Service Process to stop processing updates, without consuming any further updates from kernel. This back pressure towards the kernel affects further dynamic updates from other processes in the system, including RPD, causing a KRT-STUCK condition and traffic forwarding issues.
