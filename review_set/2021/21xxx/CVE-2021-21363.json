A collocated user can observe the process of creating a temporary sub directory in the shared temporary directory and race to complete the creation of the temporary subdirectory. This vulnerability is local privilege escalation because the contents of the `outputFolder` can be appended to by an attacker. As such, code written to this directory, when executed can be attacker controlled. For more details refer to the referenced GitHub Security Advisory. This vulnerability is fixed in version 2.4.19.
