While this requires an authenticated user session, this URL can be used from a cross-site scripting payload or from a hooked or otherwise compromised browser to leak this access token to a malicious third party. This token can be used along with the REST API to interact with Jupyter services/notebooks such as modifying or overwriting critical files, such as .bashrc or .ssh/authorized_keys, allowing a malicious user to read potentially sensitive data and possibly gain control of the impacted system.
