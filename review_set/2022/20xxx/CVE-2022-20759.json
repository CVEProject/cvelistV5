An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTPS messages to the web services interface of an affected device.

This includes privilege level 15 access to the device using management tools like the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) or the Cisco Security Manager (CSM).
