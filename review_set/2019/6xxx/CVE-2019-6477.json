TCP-pipelining may still malfunction by dropping some responses on a TCP connection where a client query pattern generates excessive outstanding queries, but the malfunction will affect that TCP connection alone and will not cause any degradation of service to other clients. An affected client connection might also appear to hang, but will clear when either the client or the server initiates a close or reset and will not remain in that state indefinitely.\n\nDisabling TCP-pipelining entirely is completely effective at mitigating the vulnerability with minimal impact to clients that use pipelined TCP connections and with no impact to clients that do not support TCP-pipelining.\n\nThe majority of Internet client DNS queries are transported over UDP or TCP without use of TCP-pipelining."

TCP-pipelining may still malfunction by dropping some responses on a TCP connection where a client query pattern generates excessive outstanding queries, but the malfunction will affect that TCP connection alone and will not cause any degradation of service to other clients. An affected client connection might also appear to hang, but will clear when either the client or the server initiates a close or reset and will not remain in that state indefinitely.\n\nDisabling TCP-pipelining entirely is completely effective at mitigating the vulnerability with minimal impact to clients that use pipelined TCP connections and with no impact to clients that do not support TCP-pipelining.\n\nThe majority of Internet client DNS queries are transported over UDP or TCP without use of TCP-pipelining."
