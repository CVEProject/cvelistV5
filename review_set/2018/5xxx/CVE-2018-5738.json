However, because of the regression introduced by change #4777, it is possible when \"recursion yes;\" is in effect and no match list values are provided for \"allow-query-cache\" or \"allow-query\" for the setting of \"allow-recursion\" to inherit a setting of all hosts from the \"allow-query\" setting default, improperly permitting recursion to all clients.

If a value is set for any of those values the behavior of allow-recursion will be set directly or inherited from one of the other values as described in the BIND Adminstrator Reference Manual section 6.2.\n\nServers which are not intended to perform recursion at all may also effectively prevent this condition by setting \"recursion no;\" in named.conf."
