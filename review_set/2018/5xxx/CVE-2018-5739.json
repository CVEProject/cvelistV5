Our scoring for this vulnerability is based on the hook points used for hook libraries distributed by ISC and also based on the assumption that the Kea server does not accept arbitrary traffic from the internet (but is protected, e.g. by firewall, and only accepts DHCP traffic from the local broadcast domain and from nearby networks via authorized DHCP relay agents.)
