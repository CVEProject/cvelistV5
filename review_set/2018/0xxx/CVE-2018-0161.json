The vulnerability is due to a condition that could occur when the affected software processes an SNMP read request that contains a request for the ciscoFlashMIB object ID (OID). An attacker could trigger this vulnerability by issuing an SNMP GET request for the ciscoFlashMIB OID on an affected device. A successful exploit could cause the affected device to restart due to a SYS-3-CPUHOG. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco devices if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software and are configured to use SNMP Version 2 (SNMPv2) or SNMP Version 3 (SNMPv3): Cisco Catalyst 2960-L Series Switches, Cisco Catalyst Digital Building Series Switches 8P, Cisco Catalyst Digital Building Series Switches 8U.
