The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation of certain parameters that are passed to the affected software via the web UI. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the affected UI to access a malicious link or by intercepting a user request for the affected UI and injecting malicious code into the request.
