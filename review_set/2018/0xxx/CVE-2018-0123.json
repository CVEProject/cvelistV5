These system files may be sensitive and should not be able to be overwritten by a user of the diagnostic shell. The vulnerability is due to lack of proper input validation for certain diagnostic shell commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device, entering the diagnostic shell, and providing crafted user input to commands at the local diagnostic shell CLI.
