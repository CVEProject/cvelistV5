The vulnerability is due to the incorrect implementation of the CLI command, resulting in a failure to free all allocated memory upon completion. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the affected device and repeatedly issuing a specific CLI command or sending a specific SNMP poll request for a specific Object Identifier (OID). A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the IP routing process to restart or to cause a device reset, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf23136."
