To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to create certain access patterns to trigger bit flips on affected memory modules, aka a Many-sided RowHammer attack. This means that, even when chips advertised as RowHammer-free are used, attackers may still be able to conduct privilege-escalation attacks against the kernel, conduct privilege-escalation attacks against the Sudo binary, and achieve cross-tenant virtual-machine access by corrupting RSA keys. The issue affects chips produced by SK Hynix, Micron, and Samsung. NOTE: tracking DRAM supply-chain issues is not straightforward because a single product model from a single vendor may use DRAM chips from different manufacturers."
