# cvelistV5
This list is a JSON 5.0 view of the CVE List at a specific "point in time" (i.e, October 24, 2022, the date of CVE Service 2.1 Phase I "Soft Deploy:).  The purpose of this snapshot is to allow for the review of upconverted historical JSON 4.0 records as the CVE Program begins the transition to the new JSON 5.0 format.

As this list is to be used mainly for CNAs to review their historical data in the new format,  it will not be maintained over time.  

During a "transitional period" the traditional CVE List (JSON 4.0 views will be maintained while a new view (through the cve.org CVE ID lookup pane) provides a view of individual CVE Records in JSON 5.0 format. 

Until CVE Services "Hard Deploy" (targeted for 1st QT, 2023) is completed, the official published CVE List can be found at the following locations.  

a) https://cve.org/Downloads:  This location contains the traditional downloadable CVE list  that is available in the following formats: csv, html, tzt, xml.

b) https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelist (JSON 4.0): The github submission pilot will continue to be maintained during the course of the JSON 4.0 --> JSON 5.0 transition.  The format is JSON 4.0 ( but it will include downconverted JSON 5.0 records) 

c) https://www.cve.org (JSON 5.0) : (CVE ID retrieval pane at the top of the page):  This view provides a rendering of individual records in JSON 5.0 format (and will include all JSON 4.0 records that have been upconverted to JSON 5.0).
