# CVE List V5

The [CVE List](https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/Glossary?activeTerm=glossaryCVEList) is catalog of all [CVE Records](https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/Glossary?activeTerm=glossaryRecord) identified by, or reported to, the [CVE Program](https://www.cve.org/).

This repository hosts bulk download files of CVE Records in [CVE JSON 5.0 format](https://www.cve.org/AllResources/CveServices#cve-json-5) (view the [schema](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema)). You may search, download, and use the content hosted in this repository, per the [CVE Program Terms of Use](https://www.cve.org/Legal/TermsOfUse).

**Legacy Format Downloads Available for Limited Time**—[Legacy format CVE List downloads](https://www.cve.org/Downloads#LegacyFormats), which are derived from CVE JSON 4.0, remain available for download on the CVE.ORG website for a limited time. These legacy formats will be **deprecated on or before December 31, 2023**. 

## Releases

This repository includes [release versions](https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/releases) of all current CVE Records generated from the official CVE Services API. Baseline releases are issued once per day at midnight and posted in the following file name format: CVE Prefix-Year-Month-Day _ Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), (e.g., “CVE 2023-03-28_0000Z”). Hourly updates are also provided on the [Releases](https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/releases) page using the same file name format, with time changes encoded at the end.

Each baseline or hourly release includes three items:

- ZIP file of all current CVE Records at midnight (e.g., “2023-03-28_all_CVEs.zip”)
- ZIP file of all CVE Records added or modified since midnight (e.g., “2023-03-28_delta_CVEs_at_2200Z.zip”)
- Release Notes for the specific release

NOTE: The most [current release](https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/releases) contains the most up-to-date CVE List content. Hourly updates contain only the most recent updates.
