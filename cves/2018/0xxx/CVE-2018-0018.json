For this workaround to be most effective, customers should disable automatic updates and manually download IDP signature updates.\n\nAlternately, cluster customers using load balancers may break cluster, run individual side-by-side configurations, off load all traffic from one node via load balancers to another node, then update the IDP policy manually on the idle node, lastly, flip flop this operation, and then return to side-by-side or cluster mode operation.\n\nCustomers unable to utilize similar design scenarios as workarounds such as the above should instead take fixes where available."
