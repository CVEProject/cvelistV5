The vulnerability is due to the improper processing of certain EAPOL messages that are received during the Wi-Fi handshake process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a man-in-the-middle position between a supplicant and an authenticator and manipulating an EAPOL message exchange to force usage of a WPA-TKIP cipher instead of the more secure AES-CCMP cipher. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct subsequent cryptographic attacks, which could lead to the disclosure of confidential information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvj29229."
