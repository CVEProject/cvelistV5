The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the portal or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.
