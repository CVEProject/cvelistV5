(Drupal 8.4.x is no longer supported and we don't normally provide security releases for unsupported minor releases. However, we are providing this 8.4.x release so that sites can update as quickly as possible. You should update to 8.4.8 immediately, then update to 8.5.3 or the latest secure release as soon as possible.)\nIf you are unable to update immediately, or if you are running a Drupal distribution that does not yet include this security release, you can attempt to apply the patch below to fix the vulnerability until you are able to update completely:\n\nPatch for Drupal 8.x (8.5.x and below)\nPatch for Drupal 7.x\nThese patches will only work if your site already has the fix from SA-CORE-2018-002 applied. (If your site does not have that fix, it may already be compromised.)"
