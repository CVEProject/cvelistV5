This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of received traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic through a wireless access point. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause CPU utilization to increase, which could result in a DoS condition on an affected device and could cause new wireless client associations to fail. Once the offending traffic stops, the affected system will return to an operational state and new client associations will succeed."
