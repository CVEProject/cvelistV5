It can be achieved via session ID prediction, allowing remote attackers to retrieve sensitive data including customer data, security system status, and event history. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. The affected products cannot simply be updated; they must be removed, but can be replaced by other Carrier software as explained in the Carrier advisory."
