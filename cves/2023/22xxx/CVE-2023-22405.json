When a device is configured with \"service-provider/SP style\" switching, and mac-limiting is configured on an Aggregated Ethernet (ae) interface, and then a PFE is restarted or the device is rebooted, mac-limiting doesn't work anymore. Please note that the issue might not be apparent as traffic will continue to flow through the device although the mac table and respective logs will indicate that mac limit is reached. Functionality can be restored by removing and re-adding the MAC limit configuration. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5k Series, EX46xx Series: All versions prior to 20.2R3-S5; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S5; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S4; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S1; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3 on; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3 on; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R2 on."
