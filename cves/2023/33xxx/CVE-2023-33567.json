This vulnerability could potentially allow a malicious user to gain unauthorized access to multiple ROS2 nodes remotely. Unauthorized access to these nodes could result in compromised system integrity, the execution of arbitrary commands, and disclosure of sensitive information. NOTE: this is disputed by multiple third parties who believe there was not reasonable evidence to determine the existence of a vulnerability."
