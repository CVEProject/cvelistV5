No permissions or special privileges are necessary to exploit the vulnerability in the com.tracfone.tfstatus app. No user interaction is required beyond installing and running a third-party app. The software build fingerprints for each confirmed vulnerable device are as follows: Nokia C200 (Nokia/Drake_02US/DRK:12/SP1A.210812.016/02US_1_080:user/release-keys and Nokia/Drake_02US/DRK:12/SP1A.210812.016/02US_1_040:user/release-keys) and Nokia C100 (Nokia/DrakeLite_02US/DKT:12/SP1A.210812.016/02US_1_270:user/release-keys, Nokia/DrakeLite_02US/DKT:12/SP1A.210812.016/02US_1_190:user/release-keys, Nokia/DrakeLite_02US/DKT:12/SP1A.210812.016/02US_1_130:user/release-keys, Nokia/DrakeLite_02US/DKT:12/SP1A.210812.016/02US_1_110:user/release-keys, Nokia/DrakeLite_02US/DKT:12/SP1A.210812.016/02US_1_080:user/release-keys, and Nokia/DrakeLite_02US/DKT:12/SP1A.210812.016/02US_1_050:user/release-keys). This malicious app sends a broadcast Intent to the receiver component named com.tracfone.tfstatus/.TFStatus. This broadcast receiver extracts a string from the Intent and uses it as an extra when it starts the com.tracfone.tfstatus/.TFStatusActivity activity component which uses the externally controlled string as an input to execute an AT command. There are two different injection techniques to successfully inject arbitrary AT commands to execute."
