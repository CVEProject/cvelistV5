This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. NOTE: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that the PDFCrowd API key is blank (also known as \"demo mode\", which is the default configuration when the plugin is installed) or known."
