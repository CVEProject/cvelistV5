Consider:\n\n 1) vCPU runs on CPU A, running task 1.\n 2) vCPU moves to CPU B, idle gets scheduled on A.  Xen skips IBPB.\n 3) On CPU B, guest kernel switches from task 1 to 2, issuing IBPB.\n 4) vCPU moves back to CPU A.  Xen skips IBPB again.\n\nNow, task 2 is running on CPU A with task 1's training still in the BTB."
