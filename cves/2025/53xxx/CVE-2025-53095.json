Prior to version 2025.628.4510, the web UI of Sunshine lacks protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to craft a malicious web page that, when visited by an authenticated user, can trigger unintended actions within the Sunshine application on behalf of that user. Specifically, since the application does OS command execution by design, this issue can be exploited to abuse the \"Command Preparations\" feature, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed with Administrator privileges when an application is launched. This issue has been patched in version 2025.628.4510."
