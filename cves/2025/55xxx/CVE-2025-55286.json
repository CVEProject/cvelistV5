This differs from the standard alpha mask surface used for the previous super-sample anti-aliasing (SSAA) method. Under certain circumstances where the path being drawn existed in whole or partly outside of the rendering surface, incorrect bounding could cause out-of-bounds access within the coverage buffer. This affects the higher-level drawing operations, such as Context.fill, Context.stroke, painter.fill, and painter.stroke, when either the .default or .multisample_4x anti-aliasing modes were used. .supersample_4x was not affected, nor was drawing without anti-aliasing. In non-safe optimization modes (consumers compiling with ReleaseFast or ReleaseSmall), this could potentially lead to invalid memory accesses or corruption. z2d v0.7.1 fixes this issue, and it's recommended to upgrade to v0.7.1, or, given the small period of time v0.7.0 has been released, use v0.7.1 immediately, skipping v0.7.0."
