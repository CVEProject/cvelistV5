While this does not lead to unintended modification of projects or tasks, it exposes users to Phishing attacks. Attackers can frame the legitimate Planka application on a malicious site to establish false trust (UI Redressing), potentially tricking users into entering sensitive information or credentials into overlaid fake forms. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because \"PLANKA uses SameSite=Strict cookies, preventing authentication in cross-origin contexts. No session can be established. No credential interception or unauthorized actions are possible. Browser Same-Origin Policy prevents the parent page from accessing iframe content. Clickjacking is not applicable on the login page. Any credential capture would require attacker-controlled input and user interaction equivalent to phishing. The security outcome depends entirely on the user's trust in the parent page. An attacker can achieve the same effect with a fully fake login page. Embedding the legitimate page adds no risk, as browsers do not show URL, certificate, or padlock indicators in cross-origin iframes.\""
