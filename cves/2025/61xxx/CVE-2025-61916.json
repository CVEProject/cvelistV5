The primary impact is allowing users to fetch data from a remote URL. This data can be then injected into spinnaker pipelines via helm or other methods to extract things LIKE idmsv1 authentication data. This also includes calling internal spinnaker API's via a get and similar endpoints. Further, depending upon the artifact in question, auth data may be exposed to arbitrary endpoints (e.g. GitHub auth headers) leading to credentials exposure. To trigger this, a spinnaker installation MUST have two things. The first is an artifact enabled that allows user input. This includes GitHub file artifacts, BitBucket, GitLab, HTTP artifacts and similar artifact providers. JUST enabling the http artifact provider will add a \"no-auth\" http provider that could be used to extract link local data (e.g. AWS Metadata information). The second is a system that can consume the output of these artifacts. e.g. Rosco helm can use this to fetch values data. K8s account manifests if the API returns JSON can be used to inject that data into the pipeline itself though the pipeline would fail. This vulnerability is fixed in versions 2025.1.6, 2025.2.3, and 2025.3.0. As a workaround, disable HTTP account types that allow user input of a given URL. This is probably not feasible in most cases. Git, Docker and other artifact account types with explicit URL configurations bypass this limitation and should be safe as they limit artifact URL loading. Alternatively, use one of the various vendors which provide OPA policies to restrict pipelines from accessing or saving a pipeline with invalid URLs."
