From versions 30.0.0-alpha.1 to before 30.0.5 and 31.0.0-alpha.1 to before 31.0.0-beta.1, Electron is vulnerable to an ASAR Integrity bypass. This only impacts apps that have the embeddedAsarIntegrityValidation and onlyLoadAppFromAsar fuses enabled. Apps without these fuses enabled are not impacted. This issue is specific to Windows, apps using these fuses on macOS are not impacted. Specifically this issue can only be exploited if the app is launched from a filesystem the attacker has write access too. i.e. the ability to edit files inside the .app bundle on macOS which these fuses are supposed to protect against. This issue has been patched in versions 30.0.5 and 31.0.0-beta.1. There are no workarounds for this issue."
