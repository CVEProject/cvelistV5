The vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of the \"next\" parameter, which is included in the application's response without adequate escaping. An attacker can exploit this flaw by tricking a user into visiting a specially crafted URL, causing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. The issue occurs even though the application has sanitization mechanisms in place."
