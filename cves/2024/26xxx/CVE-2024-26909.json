In this case, the fix is\nto move the bridge registration in the pmic_glink_altmode driver to\nafter all resources have been looked up.\n\nIncidentally, with the new dp-hpd bridge implementation, which registers\nchild devices, this is also a requirement due to a long-standing issue\nin driver core that can otherwise lead to a probe deferral loop (see\ncommit fbc35b45f9f6 (\"Add documentation on meaning of -EPROBE_DEFER\")).\n\n[DB: slightly fixed commit message by adding the word 'commit']"
