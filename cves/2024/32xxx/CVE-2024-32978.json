A security vulnerability involving insecure file permissions has been identified in the Kaminari pagination library for Ruby on Rails, concerning insecure file permissions. This vulnerability is of moderate severity due to the potential for unauthorized write access to particular Ruby files managed by the library. Such access could lead to the alteration of application behavior or data integrity issues. Users of affected versions are advised to update to Kaminari version 1.2.2 or later, where file permissions have been adjusted to enhance security. If upgrading is not feasible immediately, review and adjust the file permissions for particular Ruby files in Kaminari to ensure they are only accessible by authorized user."
