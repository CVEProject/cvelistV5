The attacker must have valid user credentials. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing an XML file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the administrator of an affected system to import a crafted XML file with malicious entries which could allow the attacker to read and write files and execute remote code within the application, aka XML Injection.
