This issue affects only the Code Monitoring feature, whereas CVE-2021-43823 also affected saved searches. A successful attack would require an authenticated bad actor to create many Code Monitors to receive confirmation that a specific string exists. This could allow an attacker to guess formatted tokens in source code, such as API keys. This issue was patched in versions 3.35.2 and 3.36.3 of Sourcegraph.
