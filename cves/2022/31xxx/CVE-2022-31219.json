Steps:1) Install or upgrade Drive Composer pro version to 2.7.12) In ABB Automation Builder Options, select External tools.3) At Drive composer pro-line, select Custom and select the installed Drive Composer pro version 2.7.1 executable typically in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\DriveWare\\Drive Composer pro\\2.7Alternatively, users are able to remove the vulnerable Drive Composer for ABB Automation Builder.
