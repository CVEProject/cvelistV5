Authenticated users of the OpenText Archive Center Administration client (Versions 16.2.3, 21.2, and older versions) could upload XML files to the application that it did not sufficiently validate. As a result, attackers could craft XML files that, when processed by the application, would cause a negative security impact such as data exfiltration or localized denial of service against the application instance and system of the user running it."
